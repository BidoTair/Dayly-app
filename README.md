## Dayly
Dayly is an app that I independently created which allows users to create daily diary entries which are saved locally on the user's phone. The app is equipped with Facebook Authentication and I also use Facebook's
Graph API in order to retrieve the user's profile picture and name. Through this app a user can share calendar entries with friends over multiple social platforms through the use of Apple's UIActivityViewController.



## Prerequisites

iOS 8.3
Only Works on iPhone


## Installing

Currently working on uploading the app to the AppStore but for now please feel free to run the code locally on Xcode.
